# Healthcare Project-Predictive-Modeling-and-Risk-Analysis-of-Thyroid-Cancer-Using-SAS
This project analyzes a healthcare dataset to identify risk factors linked to thyroid cancer. Using SAS, data was cleaned and transformed, and logistic regression with stepwise selection and random forest models were applied. The goal was to predict high-risk individuals and support early diagnosis through data-driven insights.
